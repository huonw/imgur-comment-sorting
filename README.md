imgur-comment-sorting
=====================

Experimenting with using a Wilson score confidence interval for
sorting imgur comments.

See http://dbaupp.github.com/imgur-comment-sorting/ for more info.


The pages (index.html, gallery/index.htm, gallery/*.html) are
generated by running `_download.py` and then `_make_html.py`. e.g. `_download.py 20 | _make_html.py`.

(Several files are prefixed with `_` so that Jekyll ignores them when
creating the page that is displayed at the link above.)

Python 3 is used.
