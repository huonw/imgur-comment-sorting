imgur-comment-sorting
=====================

Experimenting with using a Wilson score confidence interval for
sorting imgur comments.

See http://dbaupp.github.com/imgur-comment-sorting/ for more info.

The pages (`index.html`, `gallery/index.htm`, `gallery/*.html`) are
generated by running `_download.py` and then
`_make_html.py`. e.g. `_download.py 20 | _make_html.py`. The two
scripts have different purposes:
- `_download.py` downloads and scores the comments, and then puts them
  into a JSON list as a tree (so that comments are children of the
  comment they are replying to).
- `_make_html.py` reads in JSON as generated by `_download.py` and
  makes pretty pages. See `_make_html.py --help` for invocation
  details. (The file `_index.html` is wrapped up and converted into
  `index.html`, making it look like the rest of the site, and the
  file `_page_suffix.html` is inserted just before `</body>` on every
  page.)

Several files are prefixed with `_` so that Jekyll ignores them when
creating the site that is displayed at the link above.

Requires Python 3.
