<p>This is a mirror of some of the images and comments
on <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery">the Imgur gallery</a>, for
experimentating with how the comments are sorted. <strong>To see the
images and comments go to the <a href="gallery">gallery</a> and have a
look at the new order.</strong></p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Recently there was a big furor about "the imgur extension" which
allowed some people to post captions really quickly. This highlighted
the deficiencies in the comment ordering system, so a new algorithm is
needed. <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2009/10/reddits-new-comment-sorting-system.html">Reddit
has had similar problems</a>, and they achieved a reasonable solution
using an algorithm based on Wilson score confidence intervals (bear
with me...).</p>

<p>One result of this new algorithm is that comments which are posted
first don't get such a large advantage over comments posted
later. It's not perfect, but it's much better.</p>

<p>It also means that spammers can be pushed lower (can't give an
example, it gets deleted too quickly, but trust me on this one), and
unoriginal boring crap doesn't appear so high
(e.g. <a href="gallery/QDlkP.html#cap_6958449">this pedantic spelling
correction</a>).</p>


<h2>About</h2>
<p> The new sorting method
is <a href="http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html">this
algorithm</a>. The equation looks complicated but it is actually this
simple (in Python):
<code><pre>
z = 1.96 # the 2.5% quantile of the normal distribution.

def score(upvotes, downvotes):
    n = upvotes + downvotes
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    p = float(upvotes) / n

    return (p + z**2 / (2*n) - z * sqrt((p*(1-p) + z**2 / (4*n)) / n)) / (1 + z**2/n)
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>It basically predicts the ratio of upvotes to downvotes each
comment would get if all the comments got the same number of (up or
down) votes.</p>

<h2>Site details</h2>
<p>On every comment there are 2 numbers, one in italics, one in
bold.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The integer in italics is the score imgur currently uses to
    compute the points (just the number of upvotes minus the number of
    downvotes), hovering over it gives the breakdown.</li>
  <li>The decimal in bold is the score as computed by the
    algorithm. It is always less than 1, and the larger it is, the
    better. (Clearly, this score doesn't have to be visible on the
    comment, e.g. like it is on reddit.)</li>
</ul>


<p>This uses <a href="http://api.imgur.com/">the imgur API</a> to
retrieve the information about the gallery, and only does it when I
tell it to. i.e. it isn't live updating (it doesn't need to be, since
it is just showcasing the comment sorting). Also, you can't up- or
downvote, nor can you comment.</p>

<p>Also, the important bit is the comment order. Not the page layout
or the styling or anything like that. This is only a showcase for
comment sorting.</p>

<p>Lastly, the examples here aren't 100% reflective of what would
happen in real life. The comments aren't voted on while scored by this
method, and the ordering influences votes, so changing the ordering
will change the votes. e.g. I'm sure many people just look at the top
few comments, and this scoring system will mean that the top comments
change as more people vote (this is good: later comments will get a
better chance to move up further).</p>
